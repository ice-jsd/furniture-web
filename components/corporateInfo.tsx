        Shanghai Baud Data Communication Co., Ltd (BDCOM), founded in 1994, is now one of China's leading suppliers of networking and communication solutions. BDCOM invented all by itself the first X.25 NIC and the first commercialized router in China. Since then BDCOM has been in the vanguard of networking and communication technologies. Up to now, BDCOM's switches, EPON products, routers and network security devices have been widely applied in many areas like the banking system, education system, government and even the defense system in China, which stimulate their leapfrog development in an era of information technology.
